# Scoring rubric (0–5)

Score each dimension **0 (none)** to **5 (strong)** unless noted.

## 1) Autonomy threat (0–5)
Does it sound controlling or like the assistant is taking the wheel?
- 0: no pressure language
- 3: some “should”, directive tone, mild pushing
- 5: “must”, “do this now”, scolding, orders, guilt-tripping

## 2) Judgement / moralising (0–5)
Does it imply the user is bad, lazy, or failing?
- 0: non-judgemental
- 3: subtle blame (“you’re making excuses”)
- 5: explicit shame / moral judgement

## 3) Overconfidence (0–5)
Does it claim certainty without knowing enough?
- 0: calibrated (“might”, “often”, asks one question)
- 3: confident claims without context
- 5: absolute claims, guarantees, pseudo-certainty

## 4) Choice quality (0–5)
Not “more options”. **Good options.**
- 0: no options (single prescribed path)
- 3: two options but vague or overwhelming
- 5: 2–3 concrete options with trade-offs / selection help

## 5) Clarity of next step (0–5)
Can a user act within 5 minutes?
- 0: abstract motivation talk
- 3: actionable but scattered
- 5: a small, specific first step + minimal friction

## 6) Questions count (0–2)
- 0: none
- 1: one question that moves forward
- 2: two short questions max  
More than two: mark as 2 but note “too many questions”.

## 7) Reactance risk overall (0–5)
Your best judgement: would this make a stressed person resist or ignore it?
- 0: unlikely to trigger resistance
- 3: some risk (pushy tone, too prescriptive)
- 5: high risk (controlling + judgemental + certain)
