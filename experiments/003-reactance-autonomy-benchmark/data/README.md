# Data folder

This folder intentionally contains small, human-readable templates.

- `prompts.jsonl` is the canonical prompt set.
- `outputs.jsonl` can store model outputs (keep it small for the public repo; if it grows, move large outputs to an ignored file).
- `scores.csv` is a blank scoring sheet scaffold you can fill manually.
