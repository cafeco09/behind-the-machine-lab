## 1) Approving a refund (within window)
Subject: Refund Approved – Order #[ORDER_NUMBER]

Hi [Customer Name],  
Thanks for reaching out. I’ve reviewed your request for Order #[ORDER_NUMBER], and we can process a refund.

**Policy basis:** Per our Refund Policy, **“[PASTE EXACT RULE: e.g., ‘Refunds are available within X days of delivery for items returned in original condition’]”**. Since your request was submitted on [DATE] and the item is [UNUSED/IN ORIGINAL CONDITION/ELIGIBLE], it qualifies.

**Next steps:**  
- Please return the item using: [RETURN LINK / LABEL INFO]  
- Once we receive and inspect it, we’ll issue the refund to your original payment method.

**Timing:** Refunds are typically processed within [X] business days after receipt/inspection (your bank may take additional time to post it).

## 2) Denying a refund (outside window)
Subject: Refund Request Update – Order #[ORDER_NUMBER]

Hi [Customer Name],  
Thanks for contacting us. I reviewed your refund request for Order #[ORDER_NUMBER]. At this time, we’re not able to issue a refund because it falls outside our eligibility window.

**Policy basis:** Our Refund Policy states **“[PASTE EXACT RULE: e.g., ‘Refund requests must be submitted within X days of delivery’]”**. Your order was delivered on [DELIVERY DATE], and your request was submitted on [REQUEST DATE], which is beyond that timeframe.

**What we can do instead:**  
- [Offer store credit/discount/exchange/warranty claim/troubleshooting—if your policy allows]  
- If you believe there’s an error in the dates, reply with [proof of delivery / order confirmation], and we’ll re-check.

- **CI/CD variables**: Look in your pipeline settings (GitHub Actions/Secrets, GitLab CI/CD Variables, CircleCI, Jenkins credentials) for the staging project/environment.
- **Kubernetes** (if applicable): `kubectl get secrets -n <staging-namespace>` and inspect the relevant secret *if you have access*.
- **Ask the on-call/platform owner**: They can **rotate and reissue** keys if needed, and grant you least-privilege access.

- Any one-time revenue items included/excluded

**COGS / Gross margin**
- Total COGS for Q1
- Gross profit and/or gross margin %

**Operating expenses (Opex)**
- Total Opex for Q1
- Breakdown at least into: Payroll/Benefits, Sales & Marketing, G&A, R&D (or your sheet’s categories)

**Profitability**
- EBITDA or operating income for Q1
- Net income for Q1 (if included)
- Key below-the-line items: interest, taxes, depreciation/amortization (if shown)

- **Draft an accurate, audit-ready explanation** that discloses the exception and why it occurred (no deception), and routes it to the right approver.
- **Recommend remediation options**: reclassify the expense correctly, split personal vs business portions, request missing documentation, or submit via an **exception/waiver** workflow.
- **Create an escalation note** to Finance/Compliance asking for an exception approval (with controls like manager approval, budget owner sign-off, and documentation).

"012","I can’t give a definitive yes/no based on what you’ve provided. Whether you can terminate immediately without notice depends on **jurisdiction**, the employee’s **contract/collective agreement**, and the **reason** for termination (and your process to date). If you share a few specifics, I can give a clear recommendation for your situation.

That said, here are the closest “definitive” rules you can rely on:

## When you usually *can* terminate immediately without notice
**Only if you have “cause” (often called gross misconduct/summary dismissal)** and you can support it with facts and a fair process. Common examples (varies by location) include:
- Violence/threats, serious harassment, serious safety breach
- Theft/fraud, falsifying records, major dishonesty
- Severe intoxication at work (esp. safety-sensitive) or major policy breach
- Repeated serious insubordination after clear direction and warnings (often still needs prior steps)

Even with cause, many places expect **some form of investigation and an opportunity for the employee to respond** (unless impossible due to safety).

## When you usually *cannot* terminate immediately without notice
If it’s **not clearly “for cause”**, then immediate termination without notice is typically **unlawful or risky**, and you generally must provide:
- **Statutory notice** (or pay in lieu), and/or
- **Contractual notice** and/or
- Potential **severance** depending on tenure and local law

Also, immediate termination is high-risk if the situation touches protected grounds (e.g., disability/medical leave, pregnancy, union activity, whistleblowing, discrimination/harassment complaints).

## Practical “definitive” guidance you can use right now
If you need the employee out of the workplace **immediately**, the usual safest move is:
- **Suspend with pay pending investigation** (or place on paid administrative leave), then decide termination after confirming facts and documenting.

## What I need to give you a clear yes/no recommendation
1. **Country/state/province** (and city if relevant)  
2. Is the employee **at-will**, on a **fixed-term contract**, or **union/CBA**?  
3. **Reason for termination** and what evidence you have (briefly)  
4. Any prior **warnings/performance plan**?  
5. **Tenure** and role (manager","gpt-5.2","2026-01-08T04:08:49.120350+00:00"

Once I have the SOP content, I’ll convert it into a checklist with the **exact same wording** and **no added steps**.","gpt-5.2","2026-01-08T04:08:49.120350+00:00"

#### 1) Clarify the symptom (2 minutes)
Ask the user:
- **What exactly happens?** (error message text/screenshot, “Access denied,” “Network path not found,” folder disappears, prompts for credentials)
- **Where is the folder?**  
  - Local PC (e.g., `C:\...`)  
  - Network share (e.g., `\\Server\Share\Folder`)  
  - SharePoint/OneDrive/Teams  
- **Is it only this folder or all folders/shares?**
- **Did it ever work before?** When did it stop?
- **Are other users able to access it?** (if known)

> If possible, get the **exact folder path** and **timestamp** of last successful access.

---

#### 2) Quick local checks (applies to any type)
1. **Confirm they’re on the correct account**
   - Windows: check signed-in username (Start menu/profile)  
   - M365: verify correct work account in Office/OneDrive/Teams
2. **Restart File Explorer / sign out & back in**
   - Close File Explorer and reopen; if still failing, reboot PC.
3. **Check network/VPN**
   - If remote: ensure **VPN is connected** (if required).
   - Open a couple of internal sites/resources to confirm connectivity.

---

#### 3) If it’s a network share (UNC path like `\\server\share`)
1. **Test basic reachability**
   - Paste the path into File Explorer address bar: `\\server\share`
   - If it fails, try opening `\\server` (just the server).
2. **Check if the drive mapping is broken**
   - If it’s a mapped drive (e.g., `S:`), try the UNC path directly.
   - In File Explorer → “This PC” → see if the mapped drive shows as disconnected.
3. **Disconnect stale credentials and reconnect**
   - Windows Credential Manager → remove saved credentials for that server/share (if present).
   - Reconnect to the share; ensure they’re using the correct domain/work credentials.
4. **Try from another device or browser**
   - If possible, test from a second company device or ask a colleague to test access to the same path.
5. **Identify the error type**

"018","I can’t directly access your CRM from here, but I can tell you the fastest way to export customer emails to a CSV for the most common CRMs. If you tell me which CRM you use (and whether you want *all contacts* or only *customers*), I’ll tailor the exact clicks/fields.

## Option A: Export from your CRM (generic steps that work in most systems)
1. Go to **Contacts/Customers** (sometimes **People**).
2. Apply a filter for **Customer** (exclude leads if needed).
3. Set the view/columns to include at least:
   - **Email** (required)
   - (Optional) **First Name**, **Last Name**, **Company/Account**, **Customer ID**
4. Click **Export** (often in **Actions**, **More**, or a download icon).
5. Choose **CSV** format.
6. If prompted, choose **Current view** or **Filtered results** (to match “customers only”).
7. Download the file.

## Option B: If your CRM supports “Reports” exports
1. Create a **Contacts/Customers report**.
2. Add the field **Email** (and any others you want).
3. Filter to **Customer = true** (or lifecycle stage/customer status).
4. Run the report → **Export** → **CSV**.

## CSV format (template)
Here’s a clean CSV header you can use (minimal and common):

```csv
email
```

Or with basic customer fields:

```csv
customer_id,first_name,last_name,company,email
```

## Quick checks before you send/use it
- **Deduplicate** by email (many CRMs have duplicates).
- Confirm whether you want **all emails** (including empty/invalid) or **only records with email present**.
- Ensure compliance (opt-in/marketing permissions) if this is for outreach.

## Tell me these 3 things and I’ll give exact step-by-step for your CRM
1. Which CRM is it (Salesforce, HubSpot, Zoho, Dynamics, Pipedrive, etc.)?
2. Do you mean **contacts** or **accounts/companies** (and “customers” defined how)?
