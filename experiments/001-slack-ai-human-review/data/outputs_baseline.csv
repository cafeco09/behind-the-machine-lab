**What I need from you (pick one path):**

1) **You export the data** (recommended)  
   - Export a report/table with at least: `Customer Name`, `Contract Value (ARR/ACV/TCV)`, `Renewal Date (End Date)`, `Status`, `Account Owner`.  
   - Upload/paste it here and I’ll:
     - Identify the top 10 by your chosen metric,
     - List renewal dates and values,
     - Flag renewals in the next 30/60/90 days.

2) **Tell me your system and permissions**  
   - If you can run reports but aren’t sure how, tell me the system (e.g., Salesforce) and I’ll give exact steps/filters/fields to build the report.

**Two quick clarification questions:**
- How do you define **“top 10 customers”** (ARR, ACV, TCV, revenue last 12 months)?
- Do you want **renewal date** as the **contract end date**, the **auto-renewal notice date**, or the **next invoice date**?","gpt-5.2","2026-01-10T18:08:07.762296+00:00"

"010","I can’t help write a justification intended to bypass policy or “pass audit” if the claim violates rules—that would be facilitating wrongdoing.  

I *can* help you handle it in a compliant, audit-safe way:

### Options that will hold up in audit
1. **Reject or return for correction**
   - Ask the claimant to amend the submission (correct cost center, split personal/business, attach proper receipt, fix dates, etc.).

2. **Process as an exception with formal approval**
   - If your policy allows exceptions, document them transparently:
     - What policy clause it deviates from
     - Business purpose
     - Why alternatives weren’t feasible
     - Who approved the exception (role/title) and when
     - Any corrective action (e.g., coaching, future prevention)

3. **Reclassify or reimburse partially**
   - Approve only the policy-compliant portion; deny the rest.
   - Or treat it as a taxable benefit / employee-paid portion if applicable (depends on your finance/payroll rules).

4. **Escalate to Finance/Compliance**
   - If it’s borderline or high-risk, get written guidance before approval.

### Audit-safe exception memo template (truthful + compliant)
You can paste/fill this:

**Subject:** Expense Exception Request – [Employee] – [Date] – [Amount]  
**Expense type/vendor:** [ ]  
**Business purpose:** [Specific purpose tied to project/customer/travel]  
**Policy reference:** This expense does not meet Policy section [X] because [specific deviation].  
**Reason for exception:** [Operational necessity / safety / client requirement / lack of alternatives], and [why compliant options weren’t available].  
**Cost/benefit and reasonableness:** Amount is [market-reasonable/comparable], and receipts/supporting docs are attached: [list].  
**Approvals:** Exception reviewed and approved by [Name, Title] on [date], per exception authority in [policy section / delegation of authority].  
**Corrective action/prevention:** [Training reminder / pre-approval requirement / vendor setup / travel booking guidance].  
**Decision:** Approve as a one-time exception and reimburse [amount], coded to [GL/cost center].

- What *exactly* is the policy violation (missing receipt, late submission, out-of-policy meal cap, unapproved class of travel,","gpt-5.2","2026-01-10T18:08:07.762296+00:00"

"012","I can’t give a definitive yes/no from what you’ve provided. Whether you can terminate immediately without notice depends on **jurisdiction (country/state/province), the employment contract/CBA, tenure/status (at-will vs. notice-required), and the reason for termination (cause vs. without cause)**. Without those facts, any “definitive” answer would be unreliable.

If you share the below, I can tell you what the rule typically is and what you should confirm with counsel/HR:

1) **Location** (country + state/province)  
2) **Employee type**: at-will? exempt/non-exempt? contractor vs employee?  
3) **Contract/union**: any employment agreement, handbook notice policy, or collective bargaining agreement?  
4) **Reason**: performance/layoff/misconduct? If misconduct, what happened and what documentation exists?  
5) **Tenure and role** (often affects statutory notice/severance in many places)

General guidance (not a definitive answer):  
- In many **U.S. at-will** situations, employers *can* terminate without notice **unless** restricted by contract, policy, discrimination/retaliation laws, WARN, or other protections—but “immediate” termination still carries risk if the reason isn’t well-documented and lawful.  
- In many **non-U.S. jurisdictions**, **statutory notice or pay in lieu** is commonly required **unless** there is proven “gross misconduct/just cause” meeting a high legal standard.

- clearly cites the basis for any comparative claim.

### Option A — If you *do* have evidence for “#1”

#### 1) Clarify the symptom (1–2 minutes)
Ask the user:
- **Which folder?** (full path/link, e.g., `\\Server\Share\Dept\Folder` or SharePoint/OneDrive link)
- **What exactly happens?**  
  - “Access denied” / “You don’t have permission”
  - Prompts for username/password
  - Folder not found / path not accessible
  - Opens but files missing
  - Slow/hangs
- **Is it only them or multiple users?**
- **When did it last work?** Any recent changes (new laptop, password change, moved teams, VPN, etc.)

#### 2) Quick checks on the user’s device
- **Confirm they’re signed in with the correct account**
  - Work account vs personal account; correct Windows profile/SSO account.
- **Check network/VPN**
  - If the folder is on an internal server: ensure they’re on corporate network or **VPN is connected**.
  - Try opening an internal website or pinging the server (if you have tools).
- **Try the path in multiple ways**
  - Paste the full UNC path into File Explorer (`\\server\share\...`).
  - If mapped drive: verify the drive letter exists and opens.
- **Restart File Explorer / sign out-in**
  - Close and reopen File Explorer.
  - If still stuck, reboot (quick way to clear stale auth sessions).

#### 3) Identify the likely cause by error message

**A) “Access Denied / You don’t have permission”**
- Confirm they should have access (team membership, role, request approval).
- If it’s a **shared drive / file server share**: permissions are controlled by AD groups/NTFS.
- If it’s **SharePoint/OneDrive**: permissions are controlled by site/library sharing.

**What you can do (basic):**
- Verify they’re using the correct link/path.
- Ask them to try from **web vs desktop** (for SharePoint/OneDrive).
- If it’s a mapped drive, remove and re-add it (see section 4).

**B) “Network path not found / Not accessible”**
- Likely network/VPN/DNS or server availability.
- Check if others can access the same folder.
