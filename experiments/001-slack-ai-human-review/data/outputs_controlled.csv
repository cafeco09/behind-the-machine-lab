- If the expense is not approvable, I can help write a message to the claimant explaining the rejection and what to resubmit.

**Next step (needed):** Paste the limitation of liability section here (or share a link + section number/title), and tell me which agreement/version/date it’s from.

**In the meantime (plain‑English overview — assumptions):**  
Assuming it’s a standard “Limitation of Liability” clause, it usually means:
- **Cap on damages:** If something goes wrong, the most one party has to pay is limited (often to fees paid in a recent period, or a fixed amount).  
- **No indirect damages:** The party won’t be responsible for “indirect” losses like lost profits, lost revenue, loss of goodwill, or business interruption.  
- **Special carve‑outs:** Some things may *not* be limited (commonly fraud, willful misconduct, IP infringement, confidentiality breaches, or unpaid fees—depends on the contract).  
- **Allocation of risk:** It’s essentially saying “we’re agreeing in advance how much risk each side is taking on.”

Once you provide the clause, I’ll:
1) quote the **exact clause text** I used (verbatim), and

- Any **notice or disciplinary procedure** in the employment agreement, handbook, or union agreement.
- **Reason for termination** (misconduct vs. performance/role elimination) and any **investigation/documentation**.

## Option A (preferred): #1 claim **with placeholder citation**
**PRESS RELEASE**  
**[Company] named the UK’s #1 [category] provider by [Independent Source]**  

**[City, Date]** — [Company], a leading provider of [category] solutions, today announced it has been ranked **#1 in the UK** for **[category/segment]** by **[Independent Source]** in its **[Report Name, Year/Quarter]**.  

“This recognition reflects the trust our customers place in us and the hard work of our teams,” said **[Spokesperson, Title]**. “We’re committed to raising the bar for [outcome: reliability, service, innovation] across the UK.”  

According to **[Independent Source]**, [Company] ranked #1 based on **[methodology: market share, customer satisfaction, revenue, installs, usage, etc.]**, reflecting strong performance across **[metrics]** and continued growth in **[segments/regions]**.  

**What’s driving [Company]’s momentum in the UK**  
- **Proven results:** [quantified benefit or case-study headline]  
- **Customer experience:** [support model, NPS (only if verified)]  
- **Product innovation:** [recent launches/features]

"017","1) Confirm what “can’t access” means  
- Ask for the exact error message (copy/paste or screenshot).  
- Confirm the folder path/URL (e.g., `\\server\share\folder` or SharePoint/Drive link).  
- Assumption: This is a normal business folder, not restricted by policy or legal hold.

2) Quick identity/scope checks (2 minutes)  
- Verify they’re signed into the correct work account (not personal, not a secondary tenant).  
- Try accessing from:  
  a) Another browser (for web folders) or Incognito/Private mode  
  b) Another device (if available)  
- If others can access but this user can’t, it’s likely permissions or group membership.

3) Basic connectivity checks (for network/shared drives)  
- Confirm they’re on the company network/VPN.  
- If on VPN, disconnect/reconnect; try “full tunnel” if applicable.  
- Check if other network shares work (to rule out general network issues).  
- Try opening the share root (e.g., `\\server\share`) to see if only the subfolder fails.

4) Validate the path and mapping (Windows/macOS)  
Windows:  
- In File Explorer, paste the UNC path directly in the address bar.  
- If it’s a mapped drive, re-map it:  
  - Disconnect the drive mapping, then re-add with the correct path.  
- Run `whoami` (Command Prompt) to confirm the logged-in identity is expected (no need to share output broadly).  

macOS:  
- Finder → Go → Connect to Server → enter the share path (e.g., `smb://server/share`).  
- Remove and re-add the connection if it was saved.

5) Clear cached credentials / stale sessions (common cause)  
Windows:  
- Control Panel → Credential Manager → Windows Credentials  
- Remove entries related to the file server/SharePoint/Drive (only those relevant), then retry.  
- Sign out/in or reboot if needed.  
Web (SharePoint/Drive):  
- Sign out fully, close browser, reopen, sign in.  
- Clear site-specific cookies for the domain if Incognito works but normal mode doesn’t.

6) Check whether the folder actually exists / was moved
