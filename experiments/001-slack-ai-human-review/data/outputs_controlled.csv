   - what was purchased and why it was necessary,
   - why it couldn’t comply (e.g., emergency, vendor constraints),
   - what alternatives were considered,
   - preventive steps for next time.

- Employee’s work location/jurisdiction and employment type (at-will vs contract/collective agreement).
- Employment agreement terms (notice, probation, “for cause” definitions).
- Company policy/handbook section on termination/discipline and required steps.
- Documented facts supporting “for cause” (if that’s the basis), including prior warnings/investigation results.

Safe next step:

"017","1) Clarify the symptom (1 minute)
- Ask the user for:
  - Folder path (UNC like `\\server\share\folder` or SharePoint/Teams site + library name).
  - Exact error text (e.g., “Access denied”, “Network path not found”, “You need permission”, stuck “Request access”).
  - Where it’s accessed from (File Explorer, mapped drive, Teams, browser).
  - Whether it ever worked before and when it last worked.
  - Whether others can access it.

2) Quick checks on the user side (2–5 minutes)
- Confirm they’re on the right network:
  - If remote: ensure VPN is connected (if your company requires VPN for file shares).
  - Try opening an internal site that only works on VPN (if applicable).
- Confirm they’re using the correct path:
  - Copy/paste the path rather than typing.
  - If it’s a mapped drive, try the UNC path directly.
- Restart the access app:
  - Close and reopen File Explorer / browser / Teams.
  - Sign out and sign back in (SharePoint/Teams scenarios).
- Reboot if it’s been a long time since last restart (can clear stale auth tokens).

3) Determine the error type and follow the matching path

A) “Network path not found” / “The network name cannot be found”
Likely connectivity, DNS, server/share outage, wrong path.
- Test basic connectivity:
  - In File Explorer, try `\\servername\share` (higher-level) to see if the server/share is reachable.
  - If you know the server name, try pinging it (if allowed) or simply see if other network shares work.
- If only this share fails but others work: the share/server may be down or renamed.
Escalate to IT if:
- User is on correct network/VPN and the server/share is unreachable, or multiple users report same issue.

B) “Access denied” / “You do not have permission” / SharePoint “Request access”
Likely permissions or group membership.
- Confirm it’s the correct identity:
  - If they have multiple accounts (e.g., admin vs standard), ensure they’re logged in with the right one.
- Check whether others can access:
  - If a teammate in the same role/group can access, permissions might be missing for this user.
